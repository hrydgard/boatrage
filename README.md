This is a game that I made in 1999 I think. It won a place on the Swedish PC Gamer cover CDROM when they had a game development contest.

Its only dependency is Allegro 4.2.  5.0 won't work.

To install Allegro on ubuntu, use this:

`sudo apt install liballegro4.4 liballegro4-dev allegro4-doc`

Enjoy (or don't, it's actually not that much fun.).
